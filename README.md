ideas:

using live data from draftkings.com scrape it

user interface

ML architecture: LightGBM / XGBoost / random forest regressor / ANN / RNN / LSMN / SVM
    Most used: Gradient Boosting: Light GBM, XGBoost
                ANN
                SVM
                

with our algorithms, we want a percentage of it happening. like 65%

use past player performence to train the model

player props mainly, like paul skines over 5.5k?
